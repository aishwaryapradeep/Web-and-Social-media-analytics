Our client is a US-based mobile device maker that only recently joined the market. Being a newcomer to the market, they wish to comprehend their rivals and the preferences of their customers in order to tailor their plans. To strengthen their brand, we are trying to find features that are most valuable to the customers, and reduce the supply-demand imbalance. With this, they can make adjustments to their marketing methods and achieve their goal to boost both their brand's value and market share.


Our objective is to identify the aspects of the phones that have generated positive or negative ratings by assessing the sentiment of the reviews. This will assist business in including or enhancing those specific aspects when creating a new product. Since the data pertains to competing brands, the business will gain from not making the same error that their competition did when developing their product.
Our client may effectively create their advertising campaigns by emphasising the aspects that are most popular with consumers.
They can determine the price of their products by comparing their pricing to that of the competition and their market shares.
If a brand has a lot of reviews, it makes sense to infer that a lot of people buy their phones. This will help companies gauge the market share of their competitors.
we have Amazon review data for different cell phones and accessories that were purchased between the years 1996 and 2018.
